I bought my mark a few months ago. I didn’t have time to play with it, but I would like to use more of it.
Is there a release schedule for updates?
Is there how to page?
Can I add skills to it that I wrote?

You can find docs on the mycroft right here. Release schedule for update is biweekly, usually on thursdays. You should expect a new update this thursday. To allow other people to install your skills either using MSM (mycroft skills manager) or the install skills skill, you can do a pull request on this repo, to add your skill on there.
Hope this helps!

Hi everyone,
I found out about Mycroft through the Plexpod community in KC. I work for a global health organization called Partners In Health that provides healthcare, engages in health system strengthening activities, educates and trains health workers, and co-develops and implements open source electronic medical record systems (EMR) in low and middle income countries.
The platform we use for EMR is called OpenMRS. Users include country governments, NGOs, and private hospital systems. The platform is used in over 60 countries, with millions of patient records. One of the biggest challenges in moving from a “retrospective” to a “point-of-care” data collection model is the burden and interruption of workflow to clinicians who are already burdened with paperwork. In many countries, the government requires paperwork and the EMR data is supplemental.
I hope that somewhere out in the OpenMRS ecosystem, there is someone who would want to test Mycroft AI running on the same laptop or tablet that is running their EMR application. My organization is not positioned to do this yet, because the locations where we work are too rural and internet bandwidth is a constraint. But I hope that this idea might catch someone’s idea, and might take hold somewhere else in the world.
Please feel free to reach out for more information or you can join the OpenMRS community directly if you are a developer who is looking for an opportunity to begin the discussion about integrating voice with health data.

Hello to the group. I just purchased a donation for the Mark-II unit, and I also downloaded and installed the core to a Linux workstation to satisfy my impatience and learn more while I’m waiting for the Mark-II unit.
I know only a little bit about coding in general, but I’m looking forward to learning how to build my first Skill.
The Skill I’m hoping to build is the ability for the Ai to go to a monitoring web site and report back the values in a given frame.
I have solar panels on my home, they are grid-tied through a Solar Edge inverter which communicates data to their web site. That web site has a “public” view web page with the current statistics on my Solar Energy system.
https://monitoringpublic.solaredge.com/solaredge-web/p/kiosk?guid=3d71e75a-b8cb-48ef-8d00-6f36fd077737
I’m looking forward to seeing how far I can get.  Wish me luck!
~Eric

Hi, I ma José (jrd10) from France.
Great project, congratulations 
Not (still) a user. I will see if I can contribute in French.
